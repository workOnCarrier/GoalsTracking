# GoalsTracking

## Why do i need this?
Each year, I plan a theme for the year. e.g. (2014->challenge StatusQuo, 2015->silent contributor, 2016->challenging personal boundaries).
I have come to realize, during the routine, its is very easy to forget the theme of the year. This results in missing the desired goals.
To overcome this, i need to put a strategy in place.
* This repo is my attempt to track my strategies.

For now, I plan following tasks.
* Create a folder for 2016.
** Put a Goal definition file
** Put a milestone definition file
** Add notes to track
