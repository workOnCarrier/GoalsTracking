# 2016 Goal
# Challenging personal barriers

I have following barriers that hinder my growth.
* I am easily won over by nice behavior.
* I forgive people too easily.
* I reveal my cards too easily.
* I do not evaluate the intention of the other person.
* I put in effort without the end goal in mind.

# Personal long term goals
## Rise to powerful position in organization.
### Reasons and approach
In the organizations, that I have worked at, the environment is completely driven by people in power.
I do not like the envirionment -- specially that is riddled with politics.
So, I have only two options -- Either I change the envirionment OR I change the environment.
Rather then going on a search for a good envirionment, I with to build the good environment. That needs power.
I can be powerful, by title, or by attitude.
Going after title power demands me to get in the rat race of politics -  the very thing that I do not want.
So, I cannot wait for title power.
I will derive my power from 
* right attitude
* setting right example
* bringing positive change

## Financial well being
### Reasons and approach
When I am not limited in my acitivies by financial barriers, I can really live a good life.
The definition of a good life is
* Having enough - that gives my children to feel empowered to explore their dreams, yet not so much, that they do not feel the needs to explore.
* Having enough - that gives me the freedoom to not feel pressured into doing anything, against my core values to eak out my livelyhood.
The approach needs to be more thought about. Right now, I am just dependent upon my job to give me the job security.

## Good health
### Reasons and approach
To really live life, one needs to be healthy physically and mentally.
* I will take sufficient sleep
* I will take good exercise
* I will fulfill my mental enrichment cravings
* I will contribute back to society by some action.

## Set a good example for my children
